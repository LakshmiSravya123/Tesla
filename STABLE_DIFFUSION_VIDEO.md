# 🎬 Stable Video Diffusion Integration

## ✨ What Changed

Video generation now uses **Stable Video Diffusion** (SVD) from Stability AI!

### **Before:**
- ❌ Zeroscope V2 XL model
- ❌ Lower quality outputs
- ❌ Limited control

### **After:**
- ✅ Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) for image generation
- ✅ Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) for video animation
- ✅ Higher quality, more realistic videos
- ✅ Better motion and coherence

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Two-Step Process:**

1. **Step 1: Generate Image with SDXL**
   - Model: `stability-ai/sdxl`
   - Creates high-quality 1024x576 image from your prompt
   - Uses Stable Diffusion XL for photorealistic results

2. **Step 2: Animate with SVD**
   - Model: `stability-ai/stable-video-diffusion`
   - Takes the generated image
   - Creates 14-frame video at 6 FPS
   - Adds realistic motion and animation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **SDXL Settings:**
```python
{
    "prompt": "Your Tesla video prompt",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 576,
    "num_outputs": 1
}
```

### **SVD Settings:**
```python
{
    "input_image": "generated_image_url",
    "cond_aug": 0.02,           # Conditioning augmentation
    "decoding_t": 7,            # Decoding steps
    "video_length": "14_frames_with_svd",
    "sizing_strategy": "maintain_aspect_ratio",
    "motion_bucket_id": 127,    # Motion intensity
    "frames_per_second": 6
}
```

## ⏱️ Generation Time

- **Image Generation**: ~10-20 seconds
- **Video Generation**: ~20-60 seconds
- **Total**: ~30-90 seconds

The frontend now shows: "Generating with Stable Diffusion... (30-90 seconds)"

---

## 📊 Output Quality

### **Resolution:**
- Image: 1024x576 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Video: 14 frames at 6 FPS (~2.3 seconds)

### **Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ More photorealistic images
- ✅ Smoother motion
- ✅ Better coherence between frames
- ✅ More cinematic look

## 🚀 API Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "video_url": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
  "image_url": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
  "prompt": "Your prompt",
  "model": "Stable Video Diffusion",
  "info": "Generated with SDXL + SVD"
}
```

Now includes both the video URL and the source image URL!

## 💡 Usage Tips

### **For Best Results:**

1. **Be Specific**: Describe the scene in detail
   - ✅ "Cinematic shot of red Tesla Model Y driving through mountain road at sunset"
   - ❌ "Tesla driving"

2. **Include Motion**: Mention camera movement or action
   - ✅ "Camera pans around Tesla in showroom"
   - ✅ "Tesla accelerating on highway"

3. **Set the Scene**: Add environment details
   - ✅ "Modern Tesla Supercharger station at night with neon lights"
   - ✅ "Tesla interior with touchscreen displaying navigation"

4. **Cinematic Style**: Use film terminology
   - "Cinematic shot"
   - "Wide angle"
   - "Close-up"
   - "Drone footage"

## 🔄 Deployment

### **Backend:**
Render will automatically redeploy with the new code in 2-3 minutes.

### **Frontend:**
Vercel has already redeployed with updated messaging.

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to: https://tesla-sales-dashboard.vercel.app/videos.html
2. Select a prompt or write your own
3. Click "Generate Video"
4. Wait 30-90 seconds
5. See your Stable Diffusion generated video!

## 📈 Advantages

### **Stable Video Diffusion vs. Zeroscope:**

| Feature | Zeroscope V2 | Stable Video Diffusion |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| Quality | Good | Excellent |
| Realism | Moderate | High |
| Motion | Basic | Smooth & Natural |
| Control | Limited | Advanced |
| Resolution | 576x320 | 1024x576 |
| Coherence | Moderate | High |
