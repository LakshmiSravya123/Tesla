# ðŸ”§ Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Prompts Loading Error** âœ…
**Problem**: Videos page was trying to fetch prompts from `localhost:5000/api/prompts`

**Solution**:
- Changed API endpoint from `http://localhost:5000` to `window.location.origin`
- Added fallback sample prompts that display when API is unavailable
- Now shows 5 sample Tesla video prompts even without backend

### 2. **Analytics Data Not Loading** âœ…
**Problem**: Analytics page was trying to fetch from `localhost:5001/api/market-data`

**Solution**:
- Changed API endpoint to use `window.location.origin`
- Will gracefully handle API failures with error messages

### 3. **Dashboard Data Loading** âœ…
**Problem**: Index page was fetching from `/data.json` with absolute path

**Solution**:
- Changed to relative path `./data.json`
- Added better error handling
- Shows friendly messages when data is unavailable

## Files Modified

1. `dashboard/index.html` - Fixed data loading paths
2. `dashboard/videos.html` - Added sample prompts and fallback logic
3. `dashboard/analytics.html` - Fixed API endpoint

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import from GitHub: `LakshmiSravya123/Tesla`
3. Set **Output Directory** to `dashboard`
4. Click Deploy

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd /Users/sravyalu/Salestrend
vercel --prod
```

## What Works Now

âœ… Dashboard displays with sample data from `data.json`
âœ… Videos page shows sample prompts without API
âœ… All pages load without errors
âœ… Graceful fallbacks when API is unavailable
âœ… No hardcoded localhost URLs

## GitHub Repository

All fixes pushed to: **https://github.com/LakshmiSravya123/Tesla.git**

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel using the dashboard method
2. If you want live API data, you'll need to:
   - Deploy the Python backend separately (e.g., on Render, Railway, or Heroku)
   - Update the API endpoints in the HTML files
   - Add environment variables for API keys

For now, the dashboard works as a **static demo** with sample data!
